1.To start using C++, you need two things:
    A text editor, like Notepad, to write C++ code
    A compiler, like GCC, to translate the C++ code into a language that the computer will understand


2.C++ Install IDE
An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is used to edit AND compile the code.
Popular IDE's include Code::Blocks, Eclipse, and Visual Studio. These are all free, and they can be used to both edit and debug C++ code.
Note: Web-based IDE's can work as well, but functionality is limited.
We will use Code::Blocks in our tutorial, which we believe is a good place to start.
You can find the latest version of Codeblocks at http://www.codeblocks.org/. Download the mingw-setup.exe file, which will install the text editor with a compiler. 



3.C++ Quickstart
Let's create our first C++ file.
Open Codeblocks and go to File > New > Empty File.
Write the following C++ code and save the file as myfirstprogram.cpp (File > Save File as)


4.To start in linux terminal :
 Create a folder (any name)
    mkdir c++
    cd c++
    touch firstprog.cpp
    vi firstprog.cpp
    {Write the code}
    click esc key
    type  :wq
    g++ firstprog.cpp
    ./a.out
