C++ Structures

Structures (also called structs) are a way to group several related variables into one place. Each variable in the structure is known as a member of the structure.

Unlike an array, a structure can contain many different data types (int, string, bool, etc.).
Create a Structure

To create a structure, use the struct keyword and declare each of its members inside curly braces.

After the declaration, specify the name of the structure variable (myStructure in the example below):
struct {             // Structure declaration
  int myNum;         // Member (int variable)
  string myString;   // Member (string variable)
} myStructure;       // Structure variable
Access Structure Members

To access members of a structure, use the dot syntax (.):

Named Structures
By giving a name to the structure, you can treat it as a data type. This means that you can create variables with this structure anywhere in the program at any time.
To create a named structure, put the name of the structure right after the struct keyword:
