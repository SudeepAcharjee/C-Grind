A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.
Functions are used to perform certain actions, and they are important for reusing code: Define the code once, and use it many times.
Create a Function
C++ provides some pre-defined functions, such as main(), which is used to execute code. But you can also create your own functions to perform certain actions.
To create (often referred to as declare) a function, specify the name of the function, followed by parentheses ():
Syntax
void myFunction() {
  // code to be executed
}
Example Explained

    myFunction() is the name of the function
    void means that the function does not have a return value. You will learn more about return values later in the next chapter
    inside the function (the body), add code that defines what the function should do

Call a Function
Declared functions are not executed immediately. They are "saved for later use", and will be executed later, when they are called.
To call a function, write the function's name followed by two parentheses () and a semicolon ;
In the following example, myFunction() is used to print a text (the action), when it is called:
Example

Inside main, call myFunction():
// Create a function
void myFunction() {
  cout << "I just got executed!";
}

int main() {
  myFunction(); // call the function
  return 0;
}

/
/ Outputs "I just got executed!"


Function Declaration and Definition
A C++ function consist of two parts:
    Declaration: the return type, the name of the function, and parameters (if any)
    Definition: the body of the function (code to be executed)
void myFunction() { // declaration
  // the body of the function (definition)
}
Note: If a user-defined function, such as myFunction() is declared after the main() function, an error will occur:


Parameters and Arguments
Information can be passed to functions as a parameter. Parameters act as variables inside the function.
Parameters are specified after the function name, inside the parentheses. You can add as many parameters as you want, just separate them with a comma:
Syntax
void functionName(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
  // code to be executed
}
The following example has a function that takes a string called fname as parameter. When the function is called, we pass along a first name, which is used inside the function to print the full name:


Default Parameter Value
You can also use a default parameter value, by using the equals sign (=).
If we call the function without an argument, it uses the default value ("Norway"):
