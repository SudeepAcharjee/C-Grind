C++ Strings:
Strings are used for storing text.
A string variable contains a collection of characters surrounded by double quotes:
Example= string greeting = "Hello"; 



String Concatenation
The + operator can be used between strings to add them together to make a new string. This is called concatenation:
In the example above, we added a space after firstName to create a space between John and Doe on output. However, you could also add a space with quotes (" " or ' '):
Append:
A string in C++ is actually an object, which contain functions that can perform certain operations on strings. For example, you can also concatenate strings with the append() function:



String Length:
To get the length of a string, use the length() function:
Tip: You might see some C++ programs that use the size() function to get the length of a string. This is just an alias of length(). It is completely up to you if you want to use length() or size():



Access Strings
You can access the characters in a string by referring to its index number inside square brackets [].
Change String Characters:
To change the value of a specific character in a string, refer to the index number, and use single quotes:


User Input Strings
It is possible to use the extraction operator >> on cin to store a string entered by a user:
we often use the getline() function to read a line of text. It takes cin as the first parameter, and the string variable as second:



Omitting Namespace
You might see some C++ programs that runs without the standard namespace library. The using namespace std line can be omitted and replaced with the std keyword, followed by the :: operator for string (and cout) objects:
