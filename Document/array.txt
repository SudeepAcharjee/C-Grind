C++ Arrays
Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value.
To declare an array, define the variable type, specify the name of the array followed by square brackets and specify the number of elements it should store:
string cars[4];

Access the Elements of an Array
You access an array element by referring to the index number inside square brackets [].
This statement accesses the value of the first element in cars:


Change an Array Element
To change the value of a specific element, refer to the index number:
cars[0] = "Opel";
