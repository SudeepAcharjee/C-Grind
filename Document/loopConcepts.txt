C++ Switch Statements

Use the switch statement to select one of many code blocks to be executed.
Syntax
switch(expression) {
  case x:
    // code block
    break;
  case y:
    // code block
    break;
  default:
    // code block
}

This is how it works:

    The switch expression is evaluated once
    The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case
    If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed
    The break and default keywords are optional, and will be described later in this chapter

The break Keyword:
When C++ reaches a break keyword, it breaks out of the switch block.
This will stop the execution of more code and case testing inside the block.
When a match is found, and the job is done, it's time for a break. There is no need for more testing.




C++ Loops

Loops can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is reached.

Loops are handy because they save time, reduce errors, and they make code more readable.
C++ While Loop

The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true:
Syntax
while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
}
